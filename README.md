## üìù Instructions

[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is a list of the most critical security vulnerabilities in web applications. Each of these vulnerabilities represents a weakness that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, or compromise the integrity of an application.

In this activity, we will use the BeeBox virtual machine, which contains the vulnerable bWAPP application, to explore and exploit the vulnerabilities included in the OWASP Top 10. Through this exercise, you will gain practical insight into how the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities can be exploited.

**Objectives**

- Identify vulnerable points in bWAPP corresponding to the OWASP Top 10 categories.
- Explore how each vulnerability can be exploited to access sensitive data or compromise the application's security.
